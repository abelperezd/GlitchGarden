# Information from the repository
In this repository we find a replica of the game Plants Vs Zombies, developed in Unity. For this, I have based my work on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/)..

We have the necessary files to load the project and an executable inside the Builds folder. Also, in [this link](https://youtu.be/3CKfu3q18XU) you can find a demo video.
