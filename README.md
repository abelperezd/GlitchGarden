# GlitchGarden
In this repository we find a replica of the game Plants vs Zombies, developed in Unity. For this, I have based my work on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/).

We have the necessary files to load the project and an executable inside the Builds folder. Also, in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrOi9iC5cbY&list=PLB9_8zTTrVjrCGwse6iae4oY9OeJVtho_&index=5) you can find a demo video.
